# Modeling-budding-yeast
In this project the motility dynamics of spindle pole body, nucleus and spindle is modeled during the cell cycle


1. Geomtery of cell: file in the path: ./input/CellCoors.out

2. Geometry of spindle: elliposidal and dumbell

3. Models for dynein localization as 

        a. uniform arc: "yeast_bud_mdX.cym"

        b. offloading of dynein on mother and bud cortex: symmetric and/or differential
				
        c. offloading only at the bud-cortex

4. MT asymmetry model
      a. Differential MT dynamics of MTs emanating from the mother and daughter SPBs

5. CYTOSIM PI version ed5c1f1  

6. Also, PoC: SPB-nucleus dynamics simulated in a cell-free system
